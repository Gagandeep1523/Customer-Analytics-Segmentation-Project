# Customer-Analytics-Segmentation-Project
# Customer Analytics & Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates **end-to-end customer analytics** using **SQL and Python**, combining business intelligence with data science techniques. The goal is to generate actionable insights on customer behavior, profitability, and marketing effectiveness.

The analysis includes:
- **Customer segmentation** using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis**
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modeling**
- **Profitability analysis by region**
- **Discount impact analysis**
- **Visualizations** to support insights

The project outputs a **master CSV file** combining all analytics metrics for each customer.

## Dataset
The project uses a **synthetic retail dataset** containing the following tables:
- `customers` – customer demographic information
- `orders` – customer orders
- `order_items` – order-level product information
- `products` – product catalog
- `stores` – store locations and regions
- `returns` – returned products

## Skills & Tools
**Languages & Libraries:**
- SQL (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Key Techniques:**
- Joins, aggregations, window functions in SQL
- Data wrangling & cleaning
- RFM analysis & customer segmentation
- CLV modeling
- Profitability analysis
- Data visualization & reporting
